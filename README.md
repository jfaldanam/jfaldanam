# Welcome to my Git profile!

* Who am I? You can read more in my webpage [jfaldanam.xyz](https://jfaldanam.xyz), my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfaldanam/) for my profesional career or my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S4tk8X4AAAAJ) profile if you are interested in my research.
* In my [Gitlab profile](https://gitlab.com/jfaldanam) you will find mostly personal projects, ranging from the source to my [personal webpage](https://gitlab.com/jfaldanam/jfaldanam.gitlab.io) and [the config files from my developer setup](https://gitlab.com/jfaldanam/dotconfig) to small weekend project (such as a [Discord rich presence for the cmus music player](https://gitlab.com/jfaldanam/cmus-discord-rpc)or some [half-serious content](https://gitlab.com/jfaldanam/when-piece)) or even some of my bachelor and master's work.
* In my [Github profile](https://github.com/jfaldanam) you can find my contributions to other open-source projects hosted on the platform or some of my work at [Khaos Research](https://khaos.uma.es/), both as a researcher and developer. Some highlights are our [Scalable approach for high-resolution land cover](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-023-00770-z) \[[Source](https://github.com/KhaosResearch/landcoverpy)\] or the [Meta-optimization framework Evolver](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2023.101551) \[[Source](https://github.com/jMetal/Evolver)\] for the auto-configuration of multi-objective metaheuristics inside the jMetal family.
* Finally, all software projects related to my PhD are hosted under their own [Gitlab organization](https://gitlab.com/jfaldanam-phd), if you want to know more head over there for more information on both the software and my PhD thesis.
